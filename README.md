My Research Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub-based research portfolio. This site is built using the Al-folio template, which provides a modern framework for showcasing academic work. This repository serves as a learning exercise to explore and customize the Al-folio template.

About Me

Learning Objectives
• Understand the structure and customization options of the Al-folio template.
• Learn how to integrate academic content (publications, projects, etc.) into a static site.
