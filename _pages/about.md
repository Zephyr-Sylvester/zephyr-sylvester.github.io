As a MAC3 Antarctic Scholar, I study the impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem in the Southern Ocean. My postdoctoral research focuses on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) life history, dispersal, and ecosystem connectivity. My research combines high-resolution ocean modeling with particle tracking approaches to investigate how changing environmental conditions affect krill populations. Krill are a keystone species that supports whales, penguins, seals, and commercial fisheries in the Southern Ocean. This work directly informs management strategies for the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), bridging fundamental science with policy implementation. 

In addition to my research role, I also serve as Communications Chair for the SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG), where I coordinate international scientific collaboration and science communication efforts related to Antarctic krill research.

I am advised by Dr. Cassandra Brooks and am a member of the [The Brooks Lab](https://www.cassandrabrooks.com/research-group.html)
