But <em>why</em>? Sea ice does a lot of things at once — it provides food (ice algae), shelter from predators (in ice terraces and under-ice habitat), and physical structure that shapes the water column. Untangling which of these mechanisms matters most, and how their loss will affect larval survival differently in different habitats, is exactly what this paper attempts.</p> <p>We used a <strong>qualitative network model (QNM)</strong> — a framework that lets you integrate both well-established and hypothesized ecological interactions and test what the system predicts under different scenarios, even when you don’t have the quantitative data to parameterize a full simulation model.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center mt-4"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/untangling-infographic-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/untangling-infographic-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/untangling-infographic-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/untangling-infographic.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Untangling krill overwinter survival — infographic" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The full story in one image.

Four things shape how many juveniles make it into the adult population: spawning success and larval development in spring and summer, how well-prepared krill are heading into winter, and — the focus of this paper — how many larvae actually survive it.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/seasonal-cycles-overwintering-ZTS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/seasonal-cycles-overwintering-ZTS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/seasonal-cycles-overwintering-ZTS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/seasonal-cycles-overwintering-ZTS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Krill seasonal population dynamics" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Krill population dynamics: circumpolar krill populations increase each year through the recruitment of the previous year's juvenile class. </div> <p>Winter in the Southern Ocean is brutal for anything small and hungry. With little to no sunlight, primary productivity essentially shuts down — and with it, the food web that krill depend on.</p> <p>Adult krill have a strategy for this: they spend autumn eating as much as they can, building up lipid reserves from energy-rich prey like diatoms. Once winter hits, they stop feeding altogether and draw down those stores. They even <em>shrink</em> — physically reducing their body size to conserve energy until the light returns. It’s a remarkable adaptation, but it only works because adults have the body mass to accumulate meaningful reserves in the first place.</p> <p>Larvae don’t have that option. Too small to build lipid stores, they must keep feeding continuously throughout the winter — even when food is almost nowhere to be found. What little food is available to them comes largely from algae that has been trapped in sea ice and is slowly released as the ice melts, or from microzooplankton persisting in the water column.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/Fall-Winter-recruitement-ZTS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/Fall-Winter-recruitement-ZTS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/Fall-Winter-recruitement-ZTS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/Fall-Winter-recruitement-ZTS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Krill overwintering strategies by age class" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Krill have different overwintering strategies depending on their age: adults have lipid stores to sustain them through winter; larvae don't — and must keep feeding to survive. </div> <p>This is what makes winter the critical bottleneck for recruitment. Sea ice isn’t just frozen water — for larval krill, it’s a food source, a refuge from predators, and in some cases a physical habitat. As sea ice declines and becomes less predictable under climate change, understanding exactly <em>which</em> of these roles matters most — and <em>where</em> — becomes urgently important.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-mechanisms-control-overwinter-survival">What mechanisms control overwinter survival?</h2> <p>Food and shelter — that’s the short answer. Sea ice facilitates larval overwinter survival and subsequent recruitment by providing both.</p> <p>During the winter months, a larval krill’s ability to survive comes down to two things: access to sea ice algae as a food source, and the ability to avoid predation. The prevailing paradigm in krill biology centers on exactly this — that sea ice habitat is what makes larval survival possible, and that years with extensive, stable sea ice produce strong recruitment classes the following spring.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/food-shelter-ZTS-Ulrich-Frieir-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/food-shelter-ZTS-Ulrich-Frieir-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/overwintering/food-shelter-ZTS-Ulrich-Frieir-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/overwintering/food-shelter-ZTS-Ulrich-Frieir.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Krill swarming on the underside of sea ice" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Krill swarming on the underside of sea ice — exactly the habitat that the prevailing paradigm puts at the center of larval overwinter survival.

The ice isn’t just a backdrop, it’s actively being used, as food source and as physical structure that offers some refuge from the open water below where predators hunt.</p> <p>But this paradigm, compelling as it is, raises a harder question: <em>which</em> of these mechanisms matters most? Is it the food, the shelter, or the physical habitat structure itself? And does the answer differ depending on where in the Southern Ocean the larvae are?</p> <p>That’s what our model was designed to untangle.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-is-a-qualitative-network-model--and-why-use-one">What is a qualitative network model — and why use one?</h2> <p>It is unknown what adaptations larval krill have to survive the overwintering period and what impacts decreases in sea ice may have on krill recruitment. Current theories on overwintering mechanisms include:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Autumn food availability</strong> — krill must build condition before winter arrives</li> <li> <strong>Sea ice algae as a major energy source</strong> — ice-associated algae as a critical winter food subsidy for larvae</li> <li> <strong>Alternate food sources</strong> — microzooplankton and other pelagic prey when ice algae is unavailable</li> <li> <strong>Habitat flexibility</strong> — larval distribution shifting between under-ice and pelagic depending on the harshness of winter conditions</li> </ul> <p>Each of these mechanisms carries different implications for how krill recruitment responds to environmental change, and in particular the role of sea ice.</p> <p>While some empirical work has been done and some models have been tested, more clarity is needed in understanding how uncertain mechanisms may impact model predictions.</p> <p>This brings me to my research question: <strong>What is the impact of uncertainty in the mechanisms controlling overwintering survival on future projections of recruitment success?</strong></p> <hr> <h3 id="how-can-the-impact-of-uncertainty-in-the-mechanisms-controlling-overwintering-survival-be-quantified">How can the impact of uncertainty in the mechanisms controlling overwintering survival be quantified?</h3> <p>So how do we attempt to answer a question like this?
