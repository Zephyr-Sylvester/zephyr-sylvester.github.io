## The SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG)
#### Connecting krill researchers, coordinating international science, and bridging the gap between research and policy

The [SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG)](https://scar-krill-expert-group.github.io/) is an international network of approximately 90 researchers from 15 countries, coordinated under the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)](https://www.scar.org/). SKEG connects the people doing Antarctic krill research — with each other, with funding and ship time opportunities, and with the policy world, particularly [CCAMLR](https://www.ccamlr.org/), the commission responsible for managing the Antarctic krill fishery.

Krill research is a small enough field that coordination infrastructure makes a real, measurable difference. SKEG provides that infrastructure: facilitating collaboration across institutions and countries, identifying knowledge gaps, developing international research proposals, and making sure the science reaches the people making conservation decisions.

I've been involved with SKEG since 2021, first as the **Early Career Researcher Representative** on the steering board (2021–2023) and since 2023 as the **Communications and Outreach lead**. The work below represents what our team has built.

## Symposiums and Workshops

SKEG's annual virtual symposiums are the primary gathering point for the international krill research community. They bring together researchers across career stages and time zones for keynote presentations, research talks, idea pitches, speed-date introductions for newcomers, and task force updates. Each symposium produces a report that is submitted to CCAMLR, ensuring the community's work feeds directly into the science-policy interface.

| Year | Event | Format |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 | SKEG Mini-Symposium | Virtual (April 13–14) |
| 2025 | SKEG Science Symposium | Virtual |
| 2024 | Advancing the Krill Stock Hypothesis | Virtual workshop |
| 2023 | Krill Stock Hypothesis Development Workshop | Virtual workshop |
| 2021 | ICED Workshop: Using Models to Improve Understanding of Antarctic Krill | Virtual workshop |

Organizing virtual events across 15+ time zones for a volunteer-run scientific group requires some creative problem-solving. Over the years we've developed an approach that works: collect participant location data first, then optimize session timing around presenter availability rather than imposing a schedule up front. Registration uses Microsoft Forms for global accessibility, and the format is designed so that whether you've been studying krill for thirty years or started last month, there's a reason to show up.

## The Website

I wanted a place where anyone — researchers, students, policymakers, or the krill-curious — could go to learn about what SKEG does, what's happening in krill research, and how to get involved. That place didn't exist, so I built it.

The [SKEG website](https://scar-krill-expert-group.github.io/) serves as the central hub for the group: symposium announcements and archives, task force updates, community resources, and news. It was originally built on WordPress and has since been mirrored on GitHub Pages as a lightweight backup.

## What SKEG Does

Beyond the visible events and the website, a lot of what makes SKEG valuable is the connective tissue it provides for the krill research community:

- **Information sharing** — circulating ship time availability, funding opportunities, early-career positions, and relevant policy developments across the network
- **Task forces** — focused working groups tackling specific research questions, like the Krill Stock Hypothesis, that require coordinated international effort
- **Science-policy bridge** — ensuring that SKEG's outputs reach CCAMLR working groups and that researchers understand the management questions their work can help answer
- **Community building** — creating entry points for early-career researchers to connect with the international krill community and the science-policy process

*I serve as Communications and Outreach lead for SKEG. This page is my attempt to document what the group does and what we've built — the kind of organizational work that doesn't fit neatly into a publications list but shapes how the field operates.*
