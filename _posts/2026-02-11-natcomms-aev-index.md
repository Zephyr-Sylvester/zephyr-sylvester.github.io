I am thrilled to share that a paper I helped write **"An Antarctic ecosystem value index to quantify ecological value across trophic levels and over time"** is now published in *Nature Communications*.

> DuVivier, A.K., Krumhardt, K., Landrum, L.L., Sylvester, Z. et al. (2026). An Antarctic ecosystem value index to quantify ecological value across trophic levels and over time. *Nature Communications.* [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69011-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69011-0)

This paper is the scientific backbone of a [larger project](https://zephyr-sylvester.github.io/projects/hotspots-in-the-ice/) we've been building for several years. Here's what we found in our paper, why it matters, and what you can do with it.

### The Problem We Set Out to Solve

The Southern Ocean is changing faster than almost anywhere else on Earth. Sea ice is shifting. Productivity is reorganizing. Fisheries pressure is growing. And the international bodies charged with managing Antarctic marine resources — particularly [CCAMLR](https://www.ccamlr.org/) — need science that can answer a deceptively simple question: **where is the most ecologically valuable habitat, and will it still be valuable in the future?**

Previous work had looked at individual species or single trophic levels. We wanted a holistic picture — something that captured ecosystem value from the bottom of the food web to the top, across space and through time.

### What We Built: The Antarctic Ecosystem Value Index

The AEV Index integrates ecosystem information across trophic levels — from phytoplankton through krill and fish, up to penguins — to produce a single spatial score of ecological value for marine areas around the Antarctic continent.

The key findings:

**Polynyas are the hotspots.** Coastal polynyas — the persistent patches of open water within the sea ice — have Index values **31–72% higher** than surrounding areas. These aren't just physically interesting features; they are biologically critical ones, concentrating productivity and supporting ice-dependent species across the food web.

**High-value areas are likely to persist.** Using Earth System Model projections, we find that locations with high Index values today are generally likely to remain high-value through the end of the 21st century, despite substantial environmental change. This is not uniformly good news — it reflects the importance of protecting these places *now*, before conditions shift further.

**Penguins are the canary.** The Index reveals that penguin habitat suitability is already declining in some regions and is projected to deteriorate further. Because penguins integrate so many aspects of ecosystem health — prey availability, ice conditions, breeding habitat — their loss of importance in the Index is a meaningful signal about broader ecosystem change.

**Protection gaps exist.** While many high-value Index areas fall within existing or proposed MPAs, the analysis identifies clear opportunities for additional protection — particularly in **East Antarctica** and the **Amundsen Sea**, two regions that are ecologically important but currently without dedicated MPA proposals.

### Why This Approach Matters

Building an index that spans trophic levels required making deliberate choices about how to weight and combine fundamentally different types of data. We were intentional about developing this work iteratively, in dialogue with CCAMLR working groups over multiple years, so that the analytical choices reflected what would actually be useful for decision-making — not just what was methodologically convenient.

The result is a science product that is simultaneously a research contribution and a decision support tool. The Index isn't meant to replace expert judgment; it's meant to give that judgment better spatial and temporal grounding.

### The Tools Built on This Science

The paper is the foundation, but we also built two platforms to make this science accessible and actionable:

**[The AEV Interactive Map](https://only.one/map/antarctica-ecoindex#3.7/-85/169)** — explore the Index across species layers and flip between present-day and 2090 projections. Accompanied by narrative stories about each focal region.

**[The Index Comparison Tool](https://saef-monash.shinyapps.io/antarctic_map/)** — compare the AEV Index against all major circumpolar biodiversity analyses and bioregionalizations, and calculate quantitative overlap with any CCAMLR MPA planning domain or existing/proposed MPA.

### What's Next

This paper is part of a cluster of work coming out of our NASA-funded project. A companion methods paper — on the challenges of identifying Antarctic coastal polynyas in satellite and model data — is also in press in *The Cryosphere* (Landrum et al., in press). That work underpins the physical polynya data layer used in the AEV Index, and it deserves its own post, which is coming soon.

For a full overview of the project — including the interactive tools, team, and data — see the [project page on this site](/projects/hotspots-in-the-ice).
