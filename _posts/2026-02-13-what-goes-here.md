Most of an academic website is a list of publications, maybe some talks, a bio. But a lot of what actually makes up research — the in-between thinking, the half-formed ideas, the context that didn't make it into a paper — doesn't really have a home.

This is that home, or at least an attempt at one. No particular schedule, no theme. Just the parts of the work that would otherwise stay in a notebook somewhere. It's a learning experience in website building using jekyll/github/etc. I have no idea what I am doing, so any inconsistencies across any and all of this site are because this is a work in progress.
