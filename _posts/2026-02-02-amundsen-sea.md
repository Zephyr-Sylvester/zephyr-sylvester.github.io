## Summary of Amundsen Sea Dynamics

The Amundsen Sea features a strong seasonal sea-ice cycle with large coastal polynyas that open each summer and form episodically in winter; they are not permanently open year‑round. Polynyas are wind‑ and buoyancy‑driven, shaped by local bathymetry and grounded ice, and recent decades show regionally variable changes linked to winds and coastal freshwater fluxes.

## Seasonal ice cycle

The Amundsen Sea shows a pronounced seasonal cycle of ice advance and retreat that controls polynya occurrence and biological seasons. Open‑water polynyas recur every austral summer, while winter months host intense ice production during episodic open events.

- **Timing** Most ice production associated with the Amundsen Sea Polynya occurs in austral autumn and spring, with large contributions in April–May and September–October, and the polynya opens in all observed summers [1].  
- **Open‑water season length** The central Amundsen Polynya averaged a longer open‑water season (~132 days) than the Pine Island Polynya (~122 days) in a 1997–2010 satellite record, with large interannual variability in both polynyas [2].  
- **Ice formation rates** Observations and a one‑dimensional budget estimate intense heat loss and ice formation in the polynya mixed layer (order centimeters per day during autumn) driven by air–sea heat fluxes and lateral advection [3].  
- **Regional variability** Multi‑decadal analyses show spatially varying trends (decreases and increases) across the Amundsen Sea, indicating different local forcings for ice advance/retreat in different sectors [4].

## Polynya formation mechanisms

Polynyas in the Amundsen Sea form from a combination of atmospheric forcing, oceanic processes, and coastal geometry. Both wind‑driven coastal opening and ocean‑driven upwelling/buoyancy signals contribute, with local bathymetry and icebergs focusing the response.

- **Wind opening** Strong, persistent southeasterly or easterly winds can drive coastal polynyas by advecting sea ice away from the coast and exposing open water, sometimes producing large winter polynya events [1].  
- **Atmospheric heat loss** Surface heat loss to the atmosphere over open water accelerates mixed‑layer cooling and sea‑ice formation in autumn/winter, reinforcing polynya production [3] [5].  
- **Oceanic upwelling and warm water** Upwelling of warm deep/shelf waters near ice fronts can maintain localized open areas and explain persistent polynya locations at some ice‑shelf fronts [6].  
- **Buoyancy and meltwater influences** Freshwater from melting ice shelves (the “meltwater pump”) and buoyancy forcing modulate stratification and can help sustain or seed polynyas and associated biological productivity [7] [5].  
- **Bathymetry and grounded icebergs** Local bathymetric highs and chains of grounded icebergs act as fixed geometrical anchors for recurring polynya formation by influencing ice‑outflow pathways and creating secondary openings [1].

## Polynya temporal persistence

Polynyas in the Amundsen Sea are largely seasonal and episodic rather than permanently open. Their persistence depends on season, wind events, and broader sea‑ice conditions.

- **Seasonal recurrence** The main coastal polynya opens every summer but typically closes or is covered by new or advected ice outside the open‑water season [1].  
- **Not year‑round** While some ice‑shelf front locations show persistent warm‑water‑related openings in imagery, the large embayment‑scale Amundsen Sea Polynya does not remain continuously open year‑round in the satellite era [6] [1].  
- **Episodic winter events** During winter, intense polynya activity and most ice production occur in concentrated months (notably April–May and September–October), though strong wind events can trigger additional winter openings [1].  
- **Local trapping and closure** Ice produced within the polynya can become trapped nearby or advected back into it, which can lead to temporary closure and modulate the apparent persistence of open water [1].

## Key driving factors and recent trends

Winds, ocean heat and freshwater, and coastal geometry jointly control polynya behavior; recent observations and models indicate regional trends and feedbacks that affect ice‑shelf melt and thermocline variability. Changes in wind patterns and sea‑ice freshwater fluxes have been linked to decadal shifts in shelf stratification and ice‑shelf melt regimes.

- **Winds** Strong coastal winds are primary triggers for coastal polynyas and their winter intensity; changes in wind timing and direction have altered sea‑ice advance/retreat and polynya timing in parts of the Amundsen Sea [1] [4].  
- **Ocean heat and upwelling** Delivery of warm deep shelf waters to ice fronts sustains basal melting and can create localized persistent openings; conversely, polynya‑driven surface cooling and freshwater fluxes can modulate the thermocline and warm water volume near ice shelves [6] [8] [9].  
- **Bathymetry and grounded ice** Fixed bathymetric highs and grounded iceberg chains localize polynya formation and influence ice outflow pathways and secondary polynya creation [1].  
- **Freshwater feedbacks** Variability in sea‑ice formation and meltwater influences cross‑shelf density gradients and can drive interannual to decadal changes in shelf circulation and ice‑shelf melt rates via feedbacks with polynya buoyancy forcing [8] [9].  
- **Biophysical interactions and recent observations** High phytoplankton biomass in polynyas enhances surface warming in spring–summer, alters seasonal heat budgets, and can feed back to seasonal ice‑volume changes; satellite and in situ records show large interannual variability but no simple monotonic trend in polynya productivity over the limited observational record [10] [2] [5].  
- **Long‑term variability** Ice‑core proxies and satellite records reveal interannual to decadal variability in polynya size and timing, tied to local wind forcing and coastal icescape changes, indicating that polynya behavior has shifted regionally over the satellite era [11] [4] [2].
