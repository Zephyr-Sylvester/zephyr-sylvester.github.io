But before a krill can join the population, it has to survive one of the most precarious journeys in the ocean: sinking as an embryo toward the deep seafloor, hatching, swimming back to the surface, and then drifting for months through some of the most dynamic waters on Earth.</p> <p>This research program uses ocean modeling and Lagrangian particle tracking to understand how physical oceanography and larval biology interact to shape connectivity in early life stages.</p> <p>The goal is to build a mechanistic understanding of <em>how larvae get from where they’re spawned to where they grow up</em>. I want to know how that process changes across years, under different biological assumptions, and as the ocean and sea ice evolve under climate change.</p> <h3 id="how-ocean-physics-and-larval-biology-shape-krill-connectivity">How ocean physics and larval biology shape krill connectivity</h3> <p>Krill eggs don’t just float. After spawning, embryos sink, sometimes hundreds of meters, before hatching into larvae that swim back toward the surface. This descent-ascent cycle means that the depth of the water column, the speed of the currents at different depths, and the size of the embryo all interact to determine where a larva ends up when it reaches the surface and begins its months-long drift.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/ascent-descent-withtext-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/ascent-descent-withtext-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/ascent-descent-withtext-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/ascent-descent-withtext.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Lagrangian drifter simulation design" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Lagrangian drifter simulation design: The Primary movement of particles is determined by ocean and sea ice velocities depending on sea ice concentrations and particle depth.

By focusing on four known nursery grounds along the western Antarctic Peninsula (Bransfield Strait, Gerlache Strait, Grandidier Passage, and Marguerite Bay), we established several key dynamics:</p> <p><strong>Self-retention dominates.</strong> In our simulations, the vast majority of larvae that used a nursery ground were spawned within it. Bransfield Strait and Marguerite Bay both function as spawning and nursery grounds simultaneously, with strong local retention.</p> <p><strong>Wind drives interannual variability.</strong> The pathways between spawning areas and nursery grounds are relatively stable in structure, but their strength shifts year to year with the wind field. In the Bransfield Strait, for example, seasonal wind patterns determined whether external larvae arrived via along-shelf transport or from the Weddell Sea.</p> <p><strong>Marguerite Bay is isolated.</strong> MB received larvae mainly from the south via the Marguerite Trough and did not export larvae northward. The two ends of the wAP are functionally separated when it comes to early life stage connectivity.</p> <p><strong>Strengthening westerlies could disrupt connectivity.</strong> Projected poleward intensification of westerly winds could reduce Weddell Sea inflows to the Bransfield Strait and alter the balance of larval supply to northern nursery grounds.</p> <p>These results provided the proof of concept that motivated the next phase: taking these questions into a high-resolution regional model.</p> <h3 id="-scaling-up-high-resolution-regional-modeling">#### Scaling up: high-resolution regional modeling</h3> <p>The circumpolar model established that connectivity between spawning and nursery grounds is real, structured, and sensitive to wind variability. But its 5 km resolution and coarse drifter spacing leave fine-scale dynamics unresolved. Mesoscale eddies, complex coastline interactions, and the detailed bathymetry of straits and embayments all matter for larval retention and exchange at the scale where nursery grounds actually function.</p> <p>The current phase of this research uses a high-resolution ROMS configuration for the western Antarctic Peninsula (~1.5 km grid spacing) developed by Mike Dinniman and colleagues. This model resolves mesoscale and some submesoscale circulation features critical for larval transport in this complex coastal environment.</p> <p>With this higher resolution, we are tracking hundreds of thousands of virtual larvae through their early development, incorporating the same descent-ascent biology but now resolving the circulation patterns that the circumpolar model could not. The result is a much richer picture of how larvae interact with local bathymetry, coastal currents, and retention features within and between nursery regions.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/So-simple-ZTS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/So-simple-ZTS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/So-simple-ZTS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/So-simple-ZTS.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Circumpolar Scale" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/W%20Ap%20dark%20copy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/W%20Ap%20dark%20copy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/W%20Ap%20dark%20copy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/W%20Ap%20dark%20copy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="wAP Scale" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The wAP is the most well studied area in the Southern Ocean for Antarctic krill and is where 70% of their population is located </div> </li> <li> <h3 id="technical-approach-roms--lagrangian-particle-tracking">Technical approach: ROMS + Lagrangian particle tracking</h3> <h4 id="two-scales-one-framework">Two scales, one framework</h4> <p>This research program operates at two model resolutions, each serving a different purpose:</p> <p><strong>Circumpolar model</strong> (published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3354/meps15059" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sylvester et al. 2026, MEPS</a>)</p> <ul> <li>Southern Ocean ROMS, 5 km grid, 32 vertical layers</li> <li>ERA5 atmospheric forcing from ECMWF</li> <li>Drifters released on a 25x25 km grid across the Southern Ocean</li> <li>Simulated 2016-2019 austral summers</li> <li>Established connectivity patterns and identified key dynamics</li> </ul> <p><strong>High-resolution regional model</strong> (in progress)</p> <ul> <li>Western Antarctic Peninsula ROMS, ~1.5 km grid spacing</li> <li>Resolves mesoscale and submesoscale circulation</li> <li>Atmospheric (ERA5), oceanic boundary conditions, tidal forcing</li> <li>Simulated 2016-2019 austral summers with additional existing runs from 2006-2012</li> <li>Hundreds of thousands of drifters per simulation</li> </ul> <h4 id="what-makes-this-approach-different">What makes this approach different</h4> <p>Most larval dispersal studies treat particles as passive tracers. Our simulations incorporate the descent-ascent developmental cycle: embryos sink at empirically derived rates, hatch at depth, and larvae swim upward at stage-appropriate speeds. This means particles interact with different current regimes at different depths during their early life, producing fundamentally different connectivity patterns than passive simulations would predict.</p> <p>We also vary initial embryo size, which controls sinking rate and therefore hatching depth. This parameterization captures real biological variability (embryo size depends on maternal condition and environmental factors) and has turned out to be one of the most influential parameters in the system.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/hi-res-example-startingpoint-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/hi-res-example-startingpoint-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/projects/connectivity/hi-res-example-startingpoint-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/connectivity/hi-res-example-startingpoint.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Hi-res example" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of analyzing the wAP Lagrangian drifter release locations </div> <h4 id="data-processing-pipeline">Data processing pipeline</h4> <p>The raw model output consists of trajectory files tracking hundreds of thousands of virtual drifters at hourly resolution over 180-day simulations.
